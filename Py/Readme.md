Public Transport Route Optimization
This project implements a public transport route optimization system using machine learning models for predicting demand,and traffic, as well as for optimizing routes in real-time.

Features
Demand Prediction: Predicts demand based on historical data and sensor inputs.
Traffic Prediction: Utilizes camera data and traffic models to predict traffic conditions.
Route Optimization: Suggests optimized routes based on predicted traffic and demand.
Rerouting: Provides real-time rerouting options when traffic conditions change
