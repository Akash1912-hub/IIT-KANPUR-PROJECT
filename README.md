Fuel consuption
Current Gear: 2, RPM: 3200, Speed: 50 km/h, Sudden Brake: No, Rapid Acceleration: No -> Shift to a higher gear for better fuel efficiency.
Current Gear: 3, RPM: 2900, Speed: 40 km/h, Sudden Brake: Yes, Rapid Acceleration: No -> Avoid sudden braking; it can waste fuel.
Current Gear: 1, RPM: 4000, Speed: 30 km/h, Sudden Brake: No, Rapid Acceleration: Yes -> Avoid rapid acceleration; it increases fuel consumption.
Current Gear: 5, RPM: 2500, Speed: 60 km/h, Sudden Brake: No, Rapid Acceleration: No -> Driving behavior is efficient.
Current Gear: 4, RPM: 3100, Speed: 20 km/h, Sudden Brake: Yes, Rapid Acceleration: Yes -> Avoid sudden braking; it can waste fuel. Avoid rapid acceleration; it increases fuel consumption.
